  <h1>Hi! I'm Nicholle!! </h1>

  <p>I have spent the past decade studying education, especially education in technical subjects, before deciding to explore software engineering. She's currently using her background to try and make coding education better for newcomers. If Nicholle had to choose food or books, she would choose books. She lives with her husband and cat in California.</p>
  <p>I LOVE math, coding, data science, teaching, music, and books.</p>
  <p>I dislike cooked fish, essay writing, and driving in traffic.</p>
  <p>Fun Fact!: I have given talks about coding education on 2 continents.</p>
  <p>Here are a few links to my favorite websites!
